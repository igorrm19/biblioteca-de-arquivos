## The  Express Librarian

Welcome, developer. The "Knowledge Archive" is a legendary local library that has operated with physical index cards for 50 years. Finally, it's ready for digitization.

This is a CRUD for creating a library with file storage.

##

The stored files are in JSON format, with the JSON object generated in the body of the POST method on the localhost:3000/books route, containing the body and an ID generated by the CRUD.
```

[
  {
    "book": "assim falou zaratrusta",
    "id": "1768971490775"
  },
  {
    "book": "assim falou zaratrusta",
    "id": "1768972019122"
  },
  {
    "book": "uma breve historia da humanidade",
    "id": "1768972046380"
  }
]

```
